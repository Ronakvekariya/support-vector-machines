# Problem Statement:-
- Classif the type of drug from the features such as Age, Gender, BP, Cholesterol etc..

# Model:-
- For the purpose of understanding the diffrent and more effetive ways of approaching the classification problem.
- The SVM(Support vector machines) is used for the problem.

# Result:
- Result obtain such as accuracy , and precision and re-call were more good than logistic regression and decision tree.
- But again it depends upon the type of data and eccentric pattern of the data.
